IC computer did not write data for biases. They were taken by hand.   Object 2014HQ124_1 could not be observed at the first time it was qued, so the first observation was omitted.   We moved the 2014 HQ124_3 pointing in order to center the asteroid in the frame, to ensure that it did not go off the north side in the middle of a long observation. Ultimately, we never executed a long observation of 2014 HQ124 because of the bug.   We experimented at the end of the night with the 2014 HQ124_3 object to try to avoid the bug where files are not written to disk. This bug frequently happens when the instrument is instructed to do successive CCD images. The experiments done at the end of the night on the HQ124 object made the IR exposures longer than their simultaneous CCD exposures in order to force a pause between CCD images. Both times we tried this method, the system did not crash.   We skipped targets 1253-055, 1059-1134, Nova Musc, SDSS 1335, PHR1408-6106 and 2014 HQ124_1*	IC computer froze, Failure with Prospero	Nonphotometric	No

Skipped MCSS-14A-0001 because seeing was not low enough.  We ran two out of three sub-scripts inside the fermi_bright.pro of object 1424-41, missing the last sequence.   The first IR image of fermi_bright,pro of object 2142-75 was lost due to a mistake on the IR computer.  We see in the target 3C279 a radial structure in the guider camera, making it difficult to find a guider star. Therefore, we did not use turn on a guider star for this observation as a result. This always happens for 3C279, according to Fernando!  We took additional targets during our slack time and during the time intended to be for MCSS-14A-0001. We took observations skipped last night (140524) of Nova Musc for Yale 03A-0001 and SDSS 1335 for OSU-03B-0001.   We did encounter the typical problem, where prospero fails to write to disk the images taken. We lost only the last I filter image in the observation of object WFI2026-4536.

5/27/2014 7:00:35	140526	Rohan Naidu	Maggie Schumann, Fernando Cortes	thin clouds	1.8	1.6	1.5	7.5	0	1	3.5	0	major technical problems	Our observing time began with Prospero freezing multiple times. We lost a lot of time restarting the computer running Prospero, PONGing all the other components and running again.   As usual, the CCD write problem persisted, even in cases where IR writes were being done simultaneously. (we had conjectured from the last two nights that CCD-only queues when peppered with a few IR writes avoided the problem).  The telescope went out of sync with the dome, and then began moving on its own. We were forced to restart the TCS and recalibrate the telescope's zenith and the dome's initial position (aligned with the tape) manually.   For a brief period after the telescope's restoration we had a fruitful seeing period, soon after which the telescope's pointing went completely awry. It couldn't move to the neighbourhood of Magnitude 1/2/3 stars and these stars were invisble even on the small TV screen.  And finally when a star appeared on our screen, we weren't completely sure it was the one we asked the telescope to go to. We couldn't pull up images very often to exercise judgement because Prospero tended to crash or freeze when we did anything on the terminal other than collect data.   From here, it became extremely difficult to take data. The telescope began moving extremely slowly and we powered on-off to restore it to its speed. The telescope also continuously displayed the <<LIMIT>> error signal towards the end of the night, despite it being around zenith position.   Finally, during stowing, the telescope continued moving alone (and extremely slowly), forgetting that it once existed paired with a dome. The dome exercised similar ignorance of any synchronization. After much manual wrangling we were finally able to stow away.  Given the condition of the telescope, biases towards the end of the night weren't taken.  All in all, everything that could crash, freeze or go out of sync, did. Except the Guider.  In the semi-chaotic situation, there were other errors as well-- a) We switched the places of MB14270 and OB140801 in our queue because we somehow managed to point to a bright star near the latter object. Later we realized that these objectes were time-sensitive.  b) CT500b's lone CCD was lost to the overwrite error and couldn't be recovered because the telescope pretty much couldn't point reliably after this. c) Many targets were skipped or rendered incomplete throughout the course of the night due to all the errors mentioned. d) Because we ran out of time for SDSS1332 we implemented exactly half of its script (the RJ part).  Andy Gould's corrections were incorporated when he called in during the night.  H.Orego and D.Rojas were the engineers who attempted to fix Prospero during the day. However, the problems with it continued during the night.  Favor, tratar de revisar los problemas encontrados en el telescopio. Gracias!

5/28/2014 6:52:15	140527	 Schumann Naidu Cortes		clear	1.1	1.2	1.7	11	0	0.5	0.5	0	minor technical problems	Dome flats were taken in the afternoon and the writing problem occured.  At the beginning of the night, we experienced dome synchronization problems and called in help from the engineers. H. Arrero came and fixed the problem (muchas gracias por su ayuda!), but we lost time and were not able to complete all the early observations.   To deal with the crunch for time, we skipped observations of WASP-19 and HSPup in favor of observations of OJ287 and sn2010jl. Of course, we observed OJ287 late. The observation of sn2010jl went slightly awry, though, due to the usual writing problem. Only 11/21 CCD images were completed, but all IR images were taken. We did a full power down after experiencing the writing problem, as per our instructions.   Unfortunately, the CCD stopped working again during the following observation of 1055+018. At this point we restarted just the IR and IC computers in the interest of time; a full power down takes more than ten minutes. From this point onwards, we did not experience the writing error.   We arrived late to observations 1244-255 through 1424-41 due to the power down delays. However, none of these observations were time sensitive. In order to arrive on time to the OSU project, we took the fermi bright observation of 1510-089 late, at LST 16:20 instead of 13:36. We also observed object V728Sco early, at LST 16:34 rather than 16:54 so that we weren't sitting idle before the OSU observation. We also added in an observation of object 1622-297 from the GSU-3A-0006 project at LST16:56 because we missed it last night and had extra time. At the very end of the queue, we added in an observation of object 2155-304 for Dean Bailyn and our pet project using a script from last night.   Overall, the night went very smoothly following our initial bumps.  	IC computer froze, Synchronization problems between the dome and the telescope, Failure with Prospero	Photometric	No

5/30/2014 6:42:50	140529	Naidu Cortes Schumann		partial overcast, high humidity, cloudy	n/a	2.2	2	9	0	0	1	5	Lousy Pointing	At the beginning of the night, there were heavy clouds and humidity >80%. The dew point and temperature were also only a degree or two apart, so we waited until LST 16:10 to open the dome, at which point we attempted to do most of the still-possible observations on the queue we received this afternoon.  We had significant problems with pointing tonight. Perhaps this was due to the high seeing, but the small monitor also did not show the stars when they were outside the area of the IR display. Even very bright stars of magnitude <2 appeared as a star of magnitude 5-6 appears on a regular night. This made our later observations very difficult. When we examined the finding chart for object 2155-304, we could not locate the blasar and star 1 at all. This makes us wonder if the pointing was okay on the other objects. We think the pointing problem requires some engineering attention, if only to fix the small toshiba monitor that provides a wider field of view than the IR monitor.   We did the domebvrih calibrations and domej calibration at the beginning of the night, when the dome was closed.   We were also only able to complete half of the Chile-13B-0039 observation of WYSge early in the night because we had to hurry off to observe one of Andy Gould's targets. We redid the WYSge observation later in full, though close to dawn. We were also late for the OSU-3A-0001 observation of OB140801 that was supposed to happen at UT8:45. We started it at 8:56.

We fixed this by directing the telescope to Alpha Centauri and pointing with the paddle.  For 1235-055 and J1246+0238 we couldn't get some of the guide stars shown in the finding charts.  For 1424-41 we started at 1409 (LST) and aborted after 2 obsgos to move to a time sensitive target. We did the third one later at 1428    		Nonphotometric	No
