programs for generating the monthly night report digest from the SMARTS 1.3 and 1.5 meter observer end of night forms

night_report2.py and nr_charts.py are the top level are the codes which are recent! Use them!

Everything else is depricated, but is there just in case it becomes usefull to look at.

There is another version of nr_charts.py in the ParseFomrs directory. dont use that. its depricated.
